According to an interview in 2012 with Chuck Rossi a build engineer at Facebook Facebook compiles into a 1.5GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom BitTorrentbased release system. Rossi stated that it takes about 15 minutes to build and 15 minutes to release to the servers. The build and release process has zero downtime. Changes to Facebook are rolled out daily.191 Facebook used a combination platform based on HBase to store data across distributed machines. Using a tailing architecture events are stored in log files and the logs are tailed. The system rolls these events up and writes them to storage. The user interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users. Facebook handles requests as AJAX behavior. These requests are written to a log file using Scribe developed by Facebook.192 Data is read from these log files using Ptail an internally built tool to aggregate data from multiple Scribe stores. It tails the log files and pulls data out. Ptail data are separated into three streams and sent to clusters in different data centers Plugin impression News feed impressions Actions plugin news feed. Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow InputOutput or IO. Data is processed in batches to lessen the number of times needed to read and write under high demand periods A hot article generates many impressions and news feed impressions that cause huge data skews. Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds limited by memory used when creating a hash table.192 Data is then output in PHP format. The backend is written in Java. Thrift is used as the messaging format so PHP programs can query Java services. Caching solutions display pages more quickly. The data is then sent to MapReduce servers where it is queried via Hive.
