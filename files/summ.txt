Hardware based Mobile AR and App based Mobile AR are the two dominant platforms for Mobile AR applications. However hardware based Mobile AR i mplementation is known to be co stly and lacks flexibility while the App based one r equires additional downloading and installati on in advance and is inconvenient for cross platform deployment. In comparison Web based AR Web AR implementation can provide a pervasive Mobile AR experie nce to users thanks to the many successful deployments of the Web as a lightweight and cross platf orm service provisioning platform. Furthermore the emergence of 5G mobile communication networks have the potential to enhance the communication efficiency o f Mobile AR dense computing in the Web based approach. Most of the earlier AR studies on view management are based on standalone AR applications of which the principle components such as the tracking engine application log ic and accompanying parts are n ot clearly separated. Consequently it is difficult to reuse existing contents and application logic. In addition applying the view management scheme to various types of content is limited. However webized mobile AR content framework provides clean separ ation between the AR web browser which is in charge of tracking and rendering and content which is in charge of representing augmented data as shown in Fig. 1a. Thus it is possible to manage the AR view at the conten t level without depending on the tr acking engine and rendering identical to common web pages view management logic can be implemented in a JavaScript library form. T hus the AR content and accompanyin g view management scheme are easily reusable. B rowser that renders web pages without obstructing the view of the world when seen from an AR headset such as Ocu lus Rift Gear VR or Google Cardboard. The browser overlays the contents of the web page transpar view and is capable of modifying font size colors and layout of the web page such that it WebizedMobile Augmented Reality 201 8 1 9 Department of Computer Science Engineering Acharya IT Bangalore 107 Reference Sch ahram Dustdar Junliang Chen.
