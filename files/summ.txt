So what does that  securefilename  function actually do Now the problem is that  an uploaded file. All submitted form data can be forged and filenames can be dangerous. For the moment just remember always use that function to secure a filename before storing it directly on the filesystem.  So first we need a couple of imports. Most should be straightforward the  werkzeug.securefilename  is explained a little bit later. The  UPLOADFOLDER  is where we will store the uploaded files and the  ALLOWEDEXTENSIONS  is the set of allowed file extensi ons.  be able to upload everything there if the server is directly sending out the data to the client. That way you can make sure that users are not able to upload HTML f iles that would cause XSS problems see  Cross  Site  Scripting  XSS . Also make sure to disallow  .php  files if the server executes them but who has PHP installed on their server right
